1. What is the difference between a bump map and a normal map?

The primary difference is that normal maps have more information in them(because they use an rgb input) to give a more accurate bump effect. The rgb information in the normal maps correspond to the x,y,z axis.
Bump maps use only a black to white map to understand the depth

2. What is the difference between a "correct skybox" and simply putting a big cube around the world?

With the correct skybox, the box moves when the camera moves. However, if you just simply put a big cube around the world, eventually you will get close to the walls of the box. So the illusion that the things are far away will disappear. 

3. Why is a sphere a good object for environment mapping, but a flat square is less good?

Because the sphere is round and it has bottom and top faces that can correctly reflect the environment. However, a flat sqaure only has two sides and it limits the things that it can reflect. 

4. What are the main choices for how to represent environment map images? Why might you pick one or the other?

Cubic Environment Maps, Spherical Environment Maps, Cylindrical Environment Maps.
Cubic Environment Maps are a popular choice because they are easy to author. You just take 6 regular pictures that fit together. It is really easy in computer graphics to point the camera in 6 directions. Another advantage of cubic environment maps is that it just uses 12, usual triangles (albeit big ones).
