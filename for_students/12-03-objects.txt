Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. "car"- I used the one that I build from workbook 9
2. "sheep"- I build this sheep from the website I found on the web, which I gave the attribution in the later box.  

Five other kinds of objects that you created:
3. House-1- I used the geometry that I build in the previous workbook
4. TREE- small green trees. I actually want to make them to seem like bush.
5. bird-1 - It is also from the previous workbook that I builed. 
6. Compressor - it might be used by the villagers to crush the wheat or something
